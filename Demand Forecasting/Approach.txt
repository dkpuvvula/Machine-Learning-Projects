The given train dataset contains a total of 18,247 rows and 3 columns.

I.  Data-preprocessing

1. Checked the existence of NULL values in the columns of the train dataset and also the count of the existed NULL values in each column of the train dataset.

2. Handled missing values by imputing 'demand' column with Mean.

II. Feature Engineering

1. Added features like 'date_year', 'date_month', 'date_week', 'date_day'.

2. Dropped columns'date'

III. Modelling

After data-preprocessing and adding new features, I implemented Random Forest Regressor as my base model. This gave me 	36.374 on leaderboard.

I have implemented the other approaches like Support Vector Regressor, Decision Trees. However, the Random Forest Regressor has outperformed on Leader Board.
